# E-Commerce Sock Shop Data Processing with Kafka

## Project Overview
This project is part of an educational assignment focused on building a simulated E-Commerce Sock Shop. The core of the project revolves around using Apache Kafka, particularly Kafka Streams, to handle and process data streams related to sock sales, purchases, and inventory management.

### Key Features
- **Data Streaming with Kafka:** Utilizes Kafka topics to manage data streams about sock suppliers, purchases, and sales.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Implements Kafka Streams for real-time data processing, calculating metrics like revenue, expenses, and profit.
- **Database Integration:** Uses Kafka Connectors for seamless interaction with the database, storing and retrieving necessary data.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensures system robustness with a multi-broker Kafka setup.

### Components
- **Customers Application:** Simulates customer interactions and sales data generation.
